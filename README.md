# Guessing-Game2 
This is my guessing game which allows the user to enter any number and it tries to match it with the one generated by the game
1. You first need to run the Project so that you can run the game
2. The Game will ask you to input a number between 1 and 100
3. It will generate a random number internally
4. It will ty to match your input value with the one generated internal
5. If it doesn't match and your value is low it will print out "Too low! Try again"
6. If it doesn't match and your value is high it will print out "Too high! Try again"
7. If it matches your value it will print out "Congratulations! You guessed the number in tries"
